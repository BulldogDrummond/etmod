etmod
=====

Server-side mod for added admin functions.  Based on etpub rev 552.

This mod is intended to be a testbed for development.  Because it is
not considered a "production" codebase, you are urged not to use it
at all.

Some of the changes that will be made here may be controversial.  For
example, I intend to use only the linux code, and remove everything
else - no Windows or OSX here.  I also intend to change the build
method to cmake or auto* tools.

There is nothing wrong with scons, Windows, or OSX.  They are all
perfectly good things if they are what you want to use.

I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to etpub over the years.
I strongly urge anyone looking for a good open-codebase mod to
try out etpub.  It is very good, and you can see the source. :)
