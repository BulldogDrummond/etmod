ETMod Coding Standards
======================

Indents are to be 4 spaces.  Tabs are not allowed.

Line-ending are unix-style.

All files will end with a single blank line.

All files must have a description block in the following
format beginning at the first line of the file:

/*********************************************************
 * Project : ETMod
 *
 * File    : filename.c
 * Desc    : What the file does/is.
 *
 * Status  : Pending | Accepted
 *
 *********************************************************/

File Pending/Accepted status: This is set to pending until
the file meets the project coding standards.

If a file is not c/cpp, comment charaters should be used as
needed for the language the file is meant to use.  If the
language compiler/interpreter requires a declaration at
line one (such as #!/bin/bash), then it is acceptable to
include the description block starting at line two.
