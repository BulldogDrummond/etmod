ETMod Commit Rules
==================

Clean-up commits MUST be separate from code changes/adds.
In other words, if you are writing code to add a new
function, and you see clean-up that needs done, commit
your new code then do a separate commit for the clean-up.

THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL!  In order to easily see the code
progression, we MUST NOT mix these two.

All code should be tested to compile and execute before
being commited to the repo.  The only exceptions are
during the initial repo build, when code is being 
cleaned up for the project.  If you have multiple
commits for this situation, it is good form to mark
the commit as untested.

After Build ID 100, there are no exceptions to pre-
commit testing.
